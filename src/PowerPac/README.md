# Power Pac (Super Pac-Man)

This folder contains a semi-complete port of Super Pac-Man/Power Pac for the Sord M5 to the TI-84+ CE and Sega Master System. Because of this game's rarity, I have no problems distributing this port as a full .8xv/.sms file.

The SMS version was made due to the Sord M5's similarity to the Master System, which would allowed me to use the emulator Emulicious to automatically disassemble the game while keeping data and code separate. This disassembly would be further refined over the next two weeks to allow for a port to the TI-84+ CE.

The colors of the SMS version are off, due to Sega's hardcoded palette. Additionally, the sound is broken on the SMS version. The CE doesn't have these problems, because it lacks speakers and has a 16-bit color palette that allows for a close approximation of the M5's.

I guess I took the "Museum" part of Pac-Man Museum a bit too seriously. Enjoy! :)
