Pac-Man Plus on the CE! All you need is a decrypted Pac-Man Plus ROM! (pacplus.bin)

Pac-Man Plus is a fork of Pac-Man's code by Namco rather than a patch like Ms. Pac, so modifying it to polish further isn't really possible.

This game isn't officially part of Pac-Man Museum CE, but there's a build flag to make it one. In build.bat, replace PacPlus=0 with PacPlus=1.

In order to play Pac-Man Plus, decrypt the ROM using decrypt.c. Make sure to follow the instructions in the file.
